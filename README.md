This JavaFX project implements a simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface. 

Key features and utilizations include:

Grid Layout: The game employs a 5x5 grid layout to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

Player Interaction: Users can click on the grid cells to make their moves. Each cell visually displays 'X' or 'O' based on the player's turn.

Game Status Display: A status label at the bottom dynamically updates to indicate whose turn it is and announces the winner or a draw when the game concludes.

Responsive Design: The graphical representation of 'X' and 'O' adapts to the size of the grid cells, providing a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

Winning Logic: The game logic checks for a winning combination horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Upon winning or a draw, the game announces the result.

Scalability: The project is scalable, allowing for easy adjustment of grid size or further enhancements to the game logic.

This Tic-Tac-Toe application serves as an educational example for JavaFX GUI development, showcasing fundamental concepts of event handling, graphical elements, and game logic.
